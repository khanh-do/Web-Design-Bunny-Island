Bunny Island web site
This web site design is my own humorous look at the rabbits who reside on Okunoshima, a small island of Japan. The home page of the web site introduces the visitor to the website. The history page provides a short history of the island. The visitor guide page provides the visitor with a few tips to visiting the island.  The victims page contains a few pictures of a past tourist to the island. Finally the contact us page presents fictitious contact information to complete the website. Each page of the website are linked through the nav bar.
